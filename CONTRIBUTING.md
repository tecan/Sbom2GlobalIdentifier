## How to contribute

### Code of Conduct
This repository has adopted the Contributor Covenant as its Code of Conduct. It is expected that participants adhere to it.

## Proposing a Change
If you are unsure about whether or not a change is desired, you can create an issue. This creates the possibility for a discussion visible to everyone.

## Branching Strategy
### Main Branch
The main branch contains production-ready code.

### Develop Branch
The develop branch contains ongoing work and integration of new features before they are merged into the main production branch.

## Development Workflow
### Feature Branches
Use feature branches for developing new features.
Naming convention: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/add-new-pizza`).

### Bugfix Branches
Use bugfix branches for fixing bugs.
Naming convention: `bugfix/description` (e.g., `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).

### Hotfix Branches
For urgent fixes that need to be applied immediately to the main branch.
Naming convention: `hotfix/description` (e.g., `hotfix/critical-security-patch`).

### Release Branches
For preparing new releases.
Naming convention: `release/version` (e.g., `release/1.2.0`).

## Lifecycle

## Make an Effort to See It from Their Perspective
Remember English is not everyones native language. Written communication always lacks non-verbal communication.
With written communication in a language that is not your native tongue it is even harder to express certain 
emotions.Always assume that people mean to do right. Try to read a sentence a couple of times over and take 
things more literal. Try to place yourself in their shoes and see the message beyond the actual words.Things 
might come across different than they were intended, please keep that in mind and always check to see how 
someone meant it. If you're not sure, pull someone offline in a private channel on Twitter or email and chat about it for 
a bit. Maybe even jump on a call to collaborate. We're living in the 21st century, all the tools are there, 
why not use them to get to know each other and be friends?!Besides language, we understand that contributing 
to open-source mostly happens in your spare time. Remember that priorities might change and we can only spend 
our time once. This works as a two-way street: don't expect things to be solved instantly, but also please 
let us know if you do not have the capacity to finish work you have in progress. There is no shame in that. 
That way it's clear to other people that they can step in and take over.

## THANK YOU!
As should be clear by now: we assume everyone tries to do their best, everyone should be treated with respect 
and equally.In the unfortunate event that doesn't happen, please feel free to report it to any of the team 
members directly.We will take appropriate actions and measures if necessary.
Lastly, a big thank you for spending your precious time on our project. We appreciate any effort you make 
to help us with this project.
